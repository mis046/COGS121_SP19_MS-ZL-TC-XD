# Team Vegetable: Xuyuan Duan, Tianyi Cao, Mingqi Shen, Zhentao Lin  

Our target users are the parents who are seeking video games as gifts for their children. We are going to use APIs such as TheGamesDB, IGDB and GiantBomb for game recommendation. Then we will use shopping APIs such as Amazon and BestBuy to provide options to purchase the games. This app fits the project theme because parents, who may know little about video games and have children, are very different from ourselves. None of us have children, so none of our team members are part of the target user population.
	
Other potential topics we considered includes an app that suggests what clothing to bring in suitcase for business travels with weather API and clothing and suitcase dataset. Another app is one that recommends hiking trails and gears/supplies for hikers with various skill levels and tracks the progress of each hiker.
