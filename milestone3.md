## Milestone 3
In milestone 3, we implemented changes based on the feedback we got from our demo of milestone 2. In the child's info page, we added description for each sections such as gender, age and genre, and moved the the back button to top left of the page in order to avoid any confusion. We've also made the page able to automatically fill in what the user selected on their previous attempt. The game recommendation page also got reworked to include css styling, real-time recommendation based on our API database, as well as AJAX screenshots and description of the game we recommend.
