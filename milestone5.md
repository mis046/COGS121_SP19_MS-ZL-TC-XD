# Milestone 5
## Rubric 2 
Parents of a child might play video games themselves, but it is likely that they have no idea on what games, or genres are suitable for a child of a certain age and gender or what their child likes to play, not to mention that they may not have all popular gaming consoles to choose from. In this scenario, all they have to do is to use our app, enter their child info, game preference and console preference, and a list of games with detailed summary and screenshots will automatically be recommended to them. They can dislike games their child does not like to exclude them from the list, add games to wishlists to buy later, or mark games as already owned for reference. After that, they can either purchase the game from various online shopping platforms ditrectly from the recommendation page or go to their wishlist and check out wishlisted games there. 
## Rubrics 3 & 4: screenshots & explanation
Our UI skeleton gets a minor update in this milestone: pages that were added in the last milestone gets better styling and new QOL functions. In Wishlist, Owned and Disliked pages, Elements were rearranged, and a small icon that indicates the platform of the displayed game is now available after the game name. Users are now able to remove games from these pages as well. A new page with statistics on owned, disliked and removed games is added.

## Rubrics 5 & 6: data visualization screenshot & explanation

![alt text](https://github.com/mis046/COGS121_SP19_MS-ZL-TC-XD/blob/ms5/ms5_screenshots/statistics.png)
We used google statistics to visualize the game genre percentage of the entire wishlist, disliked and owned games libraries of the user. We grabbed the data on these categories from our database through Ajax triggered by clicking a button, and graphed it using the function given by google statistics. 


## Rubric 7: More data display & visualization ideas
Besides what we have right now, we would like to display game ratings from game reviews sites such as IGN and Metacritics as part of the game recommendation page, and allow our users to rate the games they have already owned. so that ultimately our app users' rating of the game can be displayed when other users are browsing through our game recommendations.
As far as visualization, we currently have a pie chart that displays the user's preferences. It is comprehensive, but sometimes too overwhelming at a glance. A news feed-styled statistics that randomly displays facts such as one of the favorite game, the user's all-time favorite genre can be more entertaining and straightforward for users, and can be integrated to the homepage or login page. Furthermore, we currently only display the first genre of a game in our statistics page, while most games have multiple genres. We would like to visualize the user's favorite game genre combinations, and possibly recommend new games with the same combination based on that.
